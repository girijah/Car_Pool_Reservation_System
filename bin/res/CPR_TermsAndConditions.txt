  Carpooling offers many benefits
  Carpooling will save YOU money
  Carpooling allows you to share the cost of gas and parking, cutting your expenses by nearly 50% or more; the more occupants in your carpool the more you save.  
  Carpooling is also socially economical.  Not only will you be saving, but you will also help reduce the costs we all pay towards the construction of new roads,
  road maintenance and air pollution related health costs. 

  Carpooling is better for the environment
  Having fewer cars on the road means reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and improved air quality.
  
  It’s good for your health
  According to Environment Canada, air pollution caused by vehicular travel is linked to a number of health concerns including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular
  disease, allergies and neurological effects.  By carpooling, you help reduce these health risks for yourself and everyone else. Research also suggests that 
  carpooling is less stressful than commuting alone. 

  Carpooling is convenient
  Carpooling provides commuting convenience comparable to driving alone, with less stress and with the added bonus of companionship while you’re commuting.  
  Carpooling partners establish their own unique rules that best meet the needs of their carpool. If a member wants to remove himself from any bookings or sharings,
  it should be done atleast one day before the ride. It will be charged one day before the ride, so the riding charges will be remain the same. However, for
  reducing the inconvinience for the ride offerer, please inform him by email or phone.  

  Carpooling improves your commuting options
  Carpooling offers a commuter option that may work better than other methods of transportation. Carpooling works best for people who live where transit service may
  be limited or non-existent and compared to other options, carpooling may better fit your schedule.
